READ! AIRCRAFT VERY UPSET IF TAIL HEAVY:

CoG:


I've calculated the CoG with MAC, but i'm unsure if MAC method works across multiple wing sections.

I flew with a 4s 1800 mAh battery which threw the CoG 10mm ahead of the calculated 15% value.

Because this aircraft is VERY angry at tail heavy conditions (and will take its anger out on you), I decided to just keep flying
at this value and not risk it. Try MAC values at your own risk.

Glossary:


DTFB - Dollar tree foam board. Your building material

Cut - Cut through the entire material

Score - only cut through the top paper layer of the DTFB. This is used to make airfoils and allow for bending.

Reference line - Draw this with your pen, dont cut. This is used for reference while building, e.g. to line things up
