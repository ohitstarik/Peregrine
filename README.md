READ! AIRCRAFT VERY UPSET IF TAIL HEAVY:

CoG:

I fly at: 80mm

15%: 90mm
20%: 96mm
25%: 103mm

I've calculated the CoG with MAC, but i'm unsure if MAC method works across multiple wing sections.

I fly with a 4s 1800 mAh battery which threw the CoG 10mm ahead of the calculated 15% value.

My other wing with an iNav setup flies rate mode at 100 mm with a 3s 2200 mAh battery. I've attempted Manual mode, it flies but my confidence with it during windy weather is low.  

Because this aircraft is VERY angry at tail heavy conditions (and will take its anger out on you), I decided to fly my wing without any stabilization at 80mm. Try MAC values at your own risk.

Glossary:


DTFB - Dollar tree foam board. Your building material

Cut - Cut through the entire material

Score - only cut through the top paper layer of the DTFB. This is used to make airfoils and allow for bending.

Reference line - Draw this with your pen, dont cut. This is used for reference while building, e.g. to line things up
